## Lab 1 - Web Scraping (5%)
  
1. Study and run [***`lab1.py`***](/lab1.py)
2. Run the code and examine the input for every ‘part’ of the code
   * You may need to use # to print only one part of output at a time.
3. Prepare a report to explain the function performed in this code, with the help of the print screen of the output.
4. Modify the code to perform web scraping on another website.
   * You may add additional functions to the code.

## Lab 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (5%)
* Study carefully dataset Lab2x.csv.
* Write a program (name the file Lab2x.py ) to
   1. Perform some simple exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
   2. Check and clean the dataset if necessary.
   3. Perform some meaningful exploratory (or simple statistical) data analysis on the dataset

## Lab 3 - ANOVA (5%)

* Study carefully dataset Lab3.csv .
* Study the program Lab3a.py to understand the principle of ANOVA.
* In the report, explain the code; and give conclusion to the output.
* Write a program Lab3b.py to perform the same test above, but instead of comparing the gender, we compare the effects of diet on different age groups (define the age groups yourself).
